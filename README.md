# Exploring Patterns of Environmental Justice in LA County
#### EDS 223 Homework #2

## Description
This exercise explores historical redlining in Los Angeles and its legacy on present-day environmental justice. We incorporated historical redlining data into current census tracts and environmental observations to:
- build effective, responsible, accessible and aesthetically-pleasing maps
- practice manipulating vector and raster data to build multi-layer maps
- practice making maps in R, specifically using `tmap`.
